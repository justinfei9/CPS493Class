### Hi, my name is Justin Feinman, Iâ€™m a senior comp science major at New Paltz. I enjoy listening to lots of genres of music and attending concerts. Many of my friends are in bands at New Paltz, and I try to attend their shows as often as possible. 

### A little about my computer experience is that I recently started working at the IT service desk on campus and have liked my job a lot here. I have worked on several smaller personal projects as well as created my own personal website. 

### I can see myself using what I learn in this class to update my personal website I already created and create other web applications in the future.
